.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B @TOOL_NAME@
utility creates and maintains groups of files combined into a
.BR .brarchive
archive.
Once an archive has been created, new files can be added and existing files can be
extracted, deleted, or replaced.
.PP
Files are named in the archive by their relative path from the source directory.
When matching paths listed on the command line against file names stored in the
archive, exact name matching is used.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP
.B \-c
Whenever an archive is created, an informational message to that effect is written
to standard error.  If the
.B \-c
option is specified,
.B @TOOL_NAME@
creates the archive silently.
.TP
.B \-d
Delete the specified archive files.
.TP
.B \-p
Write the contents of the specified archive files to the standard output.
If no files are specified, all files in the archive are printed.
.TP
.B \-r
Replace/add files in the archive.  If the archive does not exist, it is created.
Takes a directory as argument and recursively includes all files from that directory.
.TP
.B \-t
List the specified files in the order in which they appear in the archive.
If no files are specified, all files in the archive are listed.
.TP
.B \-v
Provide verbose output.  When used with
.BR \-x ,
.BR \-d ,
or
.BR \-r ,
an informational message is printed for each file processed.
.SH FILE FORMAT
See
.BR brarchive (5)
for details on the
.B .brarchive
file format.
.SH LIMITATIONS
Maximum file name length is 247 bytes.  Files are stored as text (UTF-8), binary
files may not work correctly.  No compression is used (uncompressed archive format).
